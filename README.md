learning how to make a repository

It's October 9th, 2016 just after midnight. Joaquim is 5 months old and Sophia is 6. We had a photo session with Ricard and one of his students today at the house. It was fun. In my 2nd semester at DeVry, teaching English at Red Balloon and realizing that I like to code. I want to learn! I love Eliza and she's great!
